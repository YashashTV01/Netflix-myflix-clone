# Netflix-like Movie Streaming Application


---

##  Project Overview

This project is a scalable, Netflix-inspired movie streaming application developed with a modern **microservices architecture** and **DevOps** automation. It provides a rich user experience with personalized content recommendations, user authentication, and seamless streaming.

Key highlights:
- Uses **TMDB API** for movie metadata and images.
- Implements a powerful **Recommendation Engine** to personalize user content.
- Built on microservices deployed with **Kubernetes** for scalability and resilience.
- Full **CI/CD pipeline** automated with Jenkins, Docker, and AWS.
- Integrated **monitoring and security** tools like Prometheus, Grafana, Trivy, and SonarQube.

##  Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Docker & Docker Compose installed  
- Kubernetes cluster (e.g., Minikube, AWS EKS, or GKE)  
- Jenkins installed and configured  
- AWS account with access to EC2 and S3  
- TMDB API key (register at [TMDB](https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api))

### Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YashashTV01/Netflix-myflix-clone.git
   cd Netflix-myflix-clone
Build and run the Docker containers:

bash
Copy code
docker-compose up --build
Deploy microservices to Kubernetes:

bash
Copy code
kubectl apply -f k8s/
Set up Jenkins CI/CD pipeline:

Import the Jenkinsfile located at /jenkins/Jenkinsfile into your Jenkins job.

Configure AWS credentials and Docker registry access in Jenkins.

Run pipeline to automate build, test, and deployment.

Configure Monitoring:

Deploy Prometheus and Grafana using manifests in /monitoring/.

Access Grafana dashboards to monitor real-time app metrics.

Security Scanning:

Run Trivy scans for container vulnerabilities.

Use SonarQube for static code analysis.
